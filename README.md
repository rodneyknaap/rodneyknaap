- 👋 Hi, I’m @rodneyknaap
- 👀 I’m interested in preservation of historic PC technology by recreating the systems in fully open concepts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FPGA design, VHDL, Verilog etc., and researching system control for the Intel 486 CPU
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my PC recreation projects if someone would be able to help me replace PC ICs such as 8237, 8259, 8254 etc in VHDL
- 📫 How to reach me rodney@knaapic.nl
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have completed the IBM PC/AT 5170 technology recreation and it's currently able to operate at 20MHz and one wait state.
